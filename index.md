## About OpenBhasa

OpenBhasa is an organization devoted to solving dataset issues for building Deep Learning Models in Indian Languages.

We host speech and language resources. These resources can be used as training corpora for speech recognition and other language work. Our focus is indian languages and quality datasets that mimic real world conversations (vocab, code switching, optimal utterance length and disfluencies).    

We publish relevance reports for other public data. Many of these reports are extremely biased by our experiences in creating commercial ASR/TTS/NLP products.   


## Our Background
We have built commercial solutions that analyze (ASR/NLI) about a million calls per week in indian languages. We realized the absence of quality data as the biggest hurdle for innovation in this space. We are trying to contribute back to the community in building high quality datasets and sharing best practices for selecting datasets for deep learning.


## Status
We are in very early stages, we neither have public data, nor members at this point. By May 2021, we should have our first data reports on some of the existing indian language public datasets.
