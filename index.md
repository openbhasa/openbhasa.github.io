## About OpenBhasa

OpenBhasa is a site devoted to hosting speech and language resources. These resources can be used as training corpora for speech recognition and other language work. Our focus is indian languages and quality datasets that mimic real world conversations (vocab, code switching, optimal utterance length and disfluencies).

We also want to publish relevance reports for other public data. Many of these reports are extremely biased by our experiences in creating commercial ASR/TTS/NLP products.


## Status
We are in very early stages, we neither have public data, nor members at this point. By May 2021, we should have our first data reports on existing indian language public data.
