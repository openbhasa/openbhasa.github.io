## About OpenBhasa

OpenBhasa is an organization devoted to solving dataset issues for building Deep Learning Models in Indian Languages.

Our goals are :
1. Host high quality speech and language resources.   
 These resources can be used as training corpora for speech recognition and other language work. Our focus is indian languages, narrowband audios and real world conversations (colloquial vocab, code switching, optimal utterance length and disfluencies). Because of privacy concerns we have to create public datasets from scratch and can not borrow production datasets. We hope someday these datasets will become benchmarks for commercial and academic research on ASR/NLP in Indian languages.
   
2. Publish relevance reports for other public datasets.   
Multiple public datasets are available, but they vary in quality and relevance for training a ASR system. Some of them use a vocab which is not used by most consumers, while others are not narrowband and do not have any of the signal issues that we see in real phone calls. Our relevance reports are extremely biased by our experiences in creating commercial ASR/TTS/NLP products. We hope some of these reports will help others in creating high quality audio datasets.     


## Our Background
We have built commercial solutions that analyze (ASR/NLI) about a million calls per week in indian languages. We realized the absence of quality data as the biggest hurdle for innovation in this space. We are trying to contribute back to the community in building high quality datasets and sharing best practices for selecting datasets for deep learning.


## Status
We are in very early stages, we neither have public data, nor members at this point. By May 2021, we should have our first data reports on some of the existing indian language public datasets.
