## Welcome to OpenBhasa
OpenBhasa is a NPO that publishes data and data quality reports for building ASR and LM for Indian Languages for business use. Based on our work on these technologies, one of the biggest hurdle in using AI in Indian context is the lack of quality data like [switchboard](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62) for Indian languages. While multiple datasets are available they either do not match realistic phone signals (compression/noise/sampling rate) or use words that are tangential to what is used by an average person who calls any business.

## Status
We are in very early stages, we neither have public data, nor members at this point. By May 2021, we should have our first data reports on existing indian language public data.
